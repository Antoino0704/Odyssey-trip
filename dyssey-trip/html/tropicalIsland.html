They were able to see various temples, walk around the city and see the statues that represented the various idols of the time. After that, our guide took them to the center of the city and showed them a large fountain with a statue of a lion on top (an animal loved by the locals). On the second day, they went to the local botanical garden. As soon as they entered, they immediately noticed the variety of local flora, full of different colors and shapes. They were able to see very old, house-sized trees, tons of brightly colored flowers, and plants of all kinds. On the third day we decided to take them to a forest and, thanks to the equipment we provided, they were able to camp with the help of our tour guide and thanks to his explanations they learned how to set up a tent to sleep as comfortably as possible.</p>
